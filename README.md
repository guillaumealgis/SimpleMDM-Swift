SimpleMDM-Swift is a cross-platform (iOS, macOS, tvOS, watchOS) SDK to access the SimpleMDM API written in Swift.

**Please Note**: This library is not officially supported by SimpleMDM. It does not currently wrap the complete functionality of the SimpleMDM API. Use at your own risk.

## Features

* Read-only access to all exposed resources (Device, App, etc.) of the REST API
* Supports the pagination API introduced August 15, 2018
* Type-safe
* Asynchronous API, relying on [Result type](https://www.swiftbysundell.com/posts/the-power-of-result-types-in-swift), and [Promises](https://github.com/promisekit) (optional API)
* High test coverage
* 100% documented

##### System requirements

+ Deployment target of iOS 11.0+ / macOS 10.13+ / tvOS 11.0+ / watchOS 4.0+
+ Xcode 11+
+ Swift 5.0+

## Usage

ðŸ“˜ Full documentation is available here: [https://guillaumealgis.github.io/SimpleMDM-Swift/](https://guillaumealgis.github.io/SimpleMDM-Swift/)

```swift
// Just set this once in your applicationDidBecomeActive method
SimpleMDM.APIKey = "233b7a3058694652ae6f62acfcba8be7"

// Get the device with id 42
Device.get(id: 42) { result in
    switch result {
    case let .failure(error):
        print("Could not get device: \(error)")
    case let .success(device):
        print(device.name)
    }
}

// Get all device groups
DeviceGroup.getAll { result in
    switch result {
    case let .failure(error):
        print("Could not get device groups: \(error)")
    case let .success(deviceGroups):
        print(deviceGroups.map { $0.name })
    }
}
```

## Installation

### Swift Package Manager

The [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/) is a tool for automating the distribution of Swift code and is integrated into the `swift` compiler and Xcode (starting at version 11).

Adding SimpleMDM-Swift as a dependency is as easy as adding it to the `dependencies` value of your `Package.swift`:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/guillaumealgis/SimpleMDM-Swift.git", .upToNextMajor(from: "0.8.0"))
]
```

Or you can use [Xcode's menu](https://wwdcbysundell.com/2019/xcode-swiftpm-first-look/) in File > Swift Packages > Add Package Dependency.

----------

### CocoaPods

To integrate SimpleMDM-Swift into your Xcode project using [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org), specify it in your `Podfile`:

```ruby
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
platform :ios, '12.0'

target '<Your Target Name>' do
    pod 'SimpleMDM-Swift', '~> 0.8.0'
end
```

Then, run the following command:

```bash
$ pod install
```

----------

### Carthage

To integrate SimpleMDM-Swift into your Xcode project using [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage), specify it in your Cartfile:

```python
github "guillaumealgis/SimpleMDM-Swift" == 0.8.0
```

Run `carthage update` to build the framework and drag the built SimpleMDM-Swift.framework into your Xcode project and update your run scripts as appropriate. For additional support, please visit the Carthage [documentation](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage#if-youre-building-for-ios-tvos-or-watchos).
