## Usage

ðŸ“˜ Full documentation is available here: [https://guillaumealgis.github.io/SimpleMDM-Swift/](https://guillaumealgis.github.io/SimpleMDM-Swift/)

```swift
// Just set this once in your applicationDidBecomeActive method
SimpleMDM.APIKey = "233b7a3058694652ae6f62acfcba8be7"

// Get the device with id 42
Device.get(id: 42) { result in
    switch result {
    case let .failure(error):
        print("Could not get device: \(error)")
    case let .success(device):
        print(device.name)
    }
}

// Get all device groups
DeviceGroup.getAll { result in
    switch result {
    case let .failure(error):
        print("Could not get device groups: \(error)")
    case let .success(deviceGroups):
        print(deviceGroups.map { $0.name })
    }
}
```

## Installation

### Swift Package Manager

The [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/) is a tool for automating the distribution of Swift code and is integrated into the `swift` compiler and Xcode (starting at version 11).

Adding SimpleMDM-Swift as a dependency is as easy as adding it to the `dependencies` value of your `Package.swift`:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/guillaumealgis/SimpleMDM-Swift.git", .upToNextMajor(from: "0.10.0"))
]
```

Or you can use [Xcode's menu](https://wwdcbysundell.com/2019/xcode-swiftpm-first-look/) in File > Swift Packages > Add Package Dependency.

platform :ios, '12.0'

target '<Your Target Name>' do
    pod 'SimpleMDM-Swift', '~> 0.10.0'
end
```

Then, run the following command:

```bash
$ pod install
```

---

### Carthage
